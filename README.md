# About Bandiani
"𝘉𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘢𝘯𝘪" is a Javanese term which means "coolness". The reason behind such name is because this hooman wants to inform the users/visitors/fellow living creatures about the many kinds of indoor plants that purify air. Hence, the name; Bandiani.

Fun fact: This humble application is the first application I have ever created #proud.

Why would I ever build this app in the first place? Stay tuned!
