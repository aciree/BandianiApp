# About Bandiani
"𝘽𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙞𝙖𝙣𝙞" is a Javanese term which means "coolness". The reason behind such name is because this hooman wants to inform the users/visitors/fellow living creatures about the many kinds of indoor plants that purify air. Hence, the name; Bandiani.

𝗙𝘂𝗻 𝗳𝗮𝗰𝘁: This humble application is THE first application I have ever created #𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗱.
